Summary: Highlights from the January, 2014 meetup.

A major highlight of the January, 2014 meetup was having sixteen people show up (a new record!).  Other than that, there were lots of lively discussions of technology goings ons, releases, politics etc.

### Some Topic Highlights (From Memory):

* The debate over Debian voting to replace SysV Init with either [Upstart or systemd](http://slashdot.org/story/13/10/28/1621219/debian-to-replace-sysvinit-switch-to-systemd-or-upstart)
* Using GPG for both signatures and encryption of email, and how to manage keychains on multiple computers

If I missed anything, leave it in the comments (or send a pull request ;).
