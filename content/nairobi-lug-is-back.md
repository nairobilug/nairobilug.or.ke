Summary: Nairobi LUG returns in Avengers' Doomsday!

*Linux User Groups are volunteer organizations whose main purpose is to advocate for the adoption and use of Linux and Free, Libre and Open-Source Software (FLOSS).*

A while back, we did a quick Google search for local groups in Kenya that were enthusiastic about Free, Libre and Open-Source software. To our amazement, the  [Nairobi GNU/Linux Users Group youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nairobilug) popped up in the search results. We watched all the videos and dissected the topics being discussed. We were hooked! The hacker-spirit, the community, the joy and the professionalism were all present and visible.

This wasn't a corporate backed group talking about a specific technology. This was different. People had come together to talk about various technologies and FLOSS. They loved it and could see its impact on the world.
They were well organized as evidenced from the digital resources in their possession. They had a [website](https://archive.ph/27asA), a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/nairobi-gnu), a [Github presence](https://github.com/nairobilug), a [Twitter account](https://x.com/nairobilug?lang=ar) and a [goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/114053-nairobi-gnu-linux-users-group). Very impressive for a mere volunteer group!

We later reached out to them on IRC and told them of our intentions of revamping the group. We did not want the spirit of the group to die after finding out that most of the pioneers had moved on to greater and better endeavours. Our intention is to create a community that is passionate about people, FLOSS and the impact technology has on society. With the blessings of the old-guard, our very first task was to get the website up and running again. if you are reading this, know that we succeeded. Nairobi Linux User Group is back!

For the second task, we need you. Yes, you! We have a meetup on the 14th of February 2026 at 1600 EAT at KFC Kimathi Street in Nairobi. We'd like to meet all of you *FLOSSheads* and talk FLOSS.The topic of discussion will be **AI and its impact on life as we know it**. Come one, come all and bring a friend!
