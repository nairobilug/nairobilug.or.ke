Summary: Highlights from the February, 2015 meetup.

Twenty people showed up, and as always some people were late, others were not. A few new people (ahem, Frank!), and others not as new whom I had not seen for a while. Big special shoutout to Maureiq, the only female member in the meetup.

### As it happened, insider info

* There was talk that everyone should try to watch the movie [Citizenfour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364) -- an eye opening documentary on privacy, surveillance and obviously the bigger picture.
* Jason talked of making an open source platform -- ma3map [client](https://github.com/ma3map/ma3map-client_android) and [server](https://github.com/ma3map/ma3map-server) -- for doing route interconnection and using machine learning to decide how to effectively recommend which matatus to take (and in which order).
* Alan mentioned that the reason that Mozilla Firefox (or any other browser) has been so slow in the last few years is [likely due to everyone using the AdBlock Plus add-on](https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/05/14/adblock-pluss-effect-on-firefoxs-memory-usage), and suggested people switch to [µBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). µBlock uses up to [two or three times less RAM](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/%C2%B5Block-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared) than AdBlock Plus on both Firefox and Chrome.
* Lots of other questions, laughs and more.

This is my first time posting so if I may have ommitted anything important, feel free to alter my [post](https://github.com/nairobilug/nairobilug.or.ke) and then make a pull request. Big thanks to all the people who taught me [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet#links)... without which this post wouldn't have been possible.

### Next time

See you all on March 7th. Meetups are usually on the first Saturday of every month at KFC, Kimathi street at 16:30. Bring a friend!
