Summary: Highlights from the November, 2013 meetup.

A major highlight of the November, 2013 meetup was having fourteen people show up; this was perhaps the most successful meetup since we began in 2012... Other than that, there were lots of lively discussions of technology goings ons, releases, politics etc.

### Some Topic Highlights (From Memory):

* Fedora 20 beta (and therefore final) [being delayed by one week](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2013-October/190689.html)
* [Cisco releasing a BSD-licensed H.264 implementation](http://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/open-source-h-264-removes-barriers-webrtc) (as well as binaries) and footing the licensing bill for users of the binary (ie, Mozilla Firefox, who [has said](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/10/30/video-interoperability-on-the-web-gets-a-boost-from-ciscos-h-264-codec/) they will integrate this)
* [OpenBSD 5.4 release](http://www.openbsd.org/54.html)
* The debate over Debian voting to replace SysV Init with either [Upstart or systemd](http://slashdot.org/story/13/10/28/1621219/debian-to-replace-sysvinit-switch-to-systemd-or-upstart)
* How to best use the recently-registered [@nairobilug](https://twitter.com/nairobilug) twitter account
* How POSIX is limiting innovation (and the creep of "Linux-isms" into POSIX)
* RAID vs JBOD
* `telnet` as a TCP/IP swiss army knife
* Processes vs threads
* The epic ending of last month's Nairobi GNU/Linux Users Group book club book, *The Picture of Dorian Gray*
* The possibility of going whitewater rafting in Uganda in December (as the Nairobi GNU/Linux Users Group "Outdoor Explorers", a related, but unofficial affiliate of the LUG)

If I missed anything, leave it in the comments (or send a pull request ;).
