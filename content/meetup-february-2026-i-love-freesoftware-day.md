Summary: Highlights from a blind date with people who answered to an invite posted on the internet. Yay to living dangerously!

After a 7 year break, we had our first meetup on the 14th of February 2026 at KFC Kimathi Street. The place was full. After all, it was Valentine's day I love Free Software day and people were definitely celebrating it.

*The thrill of having a meetup in a public restaurant from an invite posted on the internet is similar to that of having a blind date. You just can't tell who will show up. And that is the fun part, waiting to be suprised . :)*

The meetup was attended by 5 people. The 6th came in way later after it was over. *Better late than never, right?* The very first few minutes were spent by people introducing themselves and mentioning how they were involved in FLOSS. Then we got right into the meat of it.

### AI and its impact on life as we know it

AI is here. It is already part of our daily lives. Everyone in attendance agreed with that point. A concern was that if and when AI becomes largely adopted by businesses and organizations, there would be no need for employees as knowledge workers anymore. This was supported by the recent wave of layoffs in many technological companies. {insert link here}

AI development and research is still in its infancy. More time and research is needed before fully autonomous AI agents are created. This gives knowledge workers an advantage in that, current adoption at this time would be under the supervision of experienced knowledge workers who understand the business and processes. In this case, AI agents can be trainer similar to how a senior colleague mentors a junior. This wouldn't mean that inexperienced knowledge workers would not be hired. Actually it would be quite the opposite, they definitley would be hired as a resource to keep the AI agents in check. Various companies are employing this strategy as seen in IBM's case of hiring more junior developers. {insert link here}

Once AI adoption is mature, it will be like any other tool that that makes work easier and faster. This will be the case especially for work and tasks that require high levels of skill and precision. A good example is of how design software enables draftsmen to produce blue prints easier and faster than if they did the drawings manually.

Overdependence on AI will make knowledge workers incompetent. With the current capability of generative AI, these models are used even for the most trivial of tasks. It seems knowledge workers are disincentivized from applying themselves in their work. For instance, there are cases of software engineers using AI agents for task completion in their work. It is understandable given that AI agents can generate code in mere seconds. Similar code that it would take an experienced engineer minutes to an hour. However, the capability of these engineers to solve problems creatively becomes diminished as their creative muscles are not being exercised accordingly.

Generative AI can be used for crime. A simple case scenario that resonated with everyone in the group was how M-Pesa payment messages could be generated and shown to unsuspecting attendants. Many establishments only ask for the transaction code and time of payment rather than verifying the actual payment. There have been rumours that a student in JKUAT has been eating for free in the various hotels in Juja by using this trick. Another interesting case of how generative AI could be used for crime is in it being used to generate fake identification documents to be used to bypass the KYC process when opening bank accounts. You can read all about that [here]()

With regards to open-source software, AI has a good case in helping out with contributions. It would ease the burden on maintainers and lower the barrier of contribution on new contributors. The challenge is that most popular AI models are proprietary. This means that the contributions they make might not be in alignment with the licenses of open-source software. Such contributions are likely not to be merged when submitted upstream. This is evident from the case of a contributor who used AI in submitting code to the Numpy codebase.

### Merchandise

Once the meetup was over, the attendees got stickers, mousepads and t-shirts.


### March Meetup

Remember, we meet the first Saturday of the month, meaning March's meetup should be on March 7th.  See you there!
